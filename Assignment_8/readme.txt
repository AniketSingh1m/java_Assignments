Java Exception Handling
This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate exception handling using custom exception classes.

Assignment 8
This assignment has two parts:

Part 1: A Java program to find the factorial of n integers (as command line arguments CLA). It also includes a custom exception class MyExcep to validate integer values to be in a certain range.
Part 2: A Java program that defines an exception class NOMATCHEXCP that is thrown when the string from the keyboard is not equal to "India". It demonstrates the use of the custom exception class in a try-catch block.
Each program is contained in its own Java file and can be compiled and run independently.
