The provided Java code implements a menu-driven program to perform operations on an array of objects of a student class. The operations include adding, displaying, searching, updating, and deleting student records.

The student class describes attributes of a student like PRN, name, date of birth, and marks. It has a constructor to initialize these attributes and getter/setter methods to access them. The student_functions class has methods to perform the required operations on the array of student objects.

In the main function, a student_functions object is created and a menu is displayed to perform the operations. The program accepts user input and calls the corresponding method of the student_functions object to perform the operation. The program exits when the user selects the exit option from the menu.

The program implements the required functionality, but there is scope for improvement. For example, the add_student method could be modified to validate user input and handle exceptions. Similarly, the search method could be extended to search by other attributes like name and marks. Additionally, the code could be formatted to adhere to Java code conventions.
