This Java program demonstrates the use of JDBC to connect to a MySQL database, perform insert and update operations, and display the contents of a table using a ResultSet. The program uses the com.mysql.jdbc.Driver class to establish a connection to a MySQL database using a URL, username, and password. It then creates a Statement object to execute SQL queries and updates. Finally, it displays the contents of the student_jdbc table using a ResultSet object.

Note: This program assumes that a MySQL database named jdbcdemo exists on the local machine with a table named student_jdbc containing columns id, name, age, and gender. The program can be modified to work with different databases and tables by changing the URL and SQL queries accordingly.
