This code implements a RationalNumber class that can perform various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison of rational numbers. It also includes exception handling for certain cases such as dividing by zero.

The main method takes input arguments from the command line and creates two RationalNumber objects with the given numerator and denominator values. It then performs the specified operation on these objects based on the fifth argument passed.

However, in the current implementation, the main method is commented out and not executed. To execute the code, uncomment the relevant section based on the desired operation and run the program.

Note that the code assumes that the input arguments passed to the program are valid integers and are provided in the correct order. Any errors in the input arguments can result in runtime exceptions. Therefore, it is recommended to add additional input validation to the code to handle such cases.
