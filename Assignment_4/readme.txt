This program simulates a deck of 52 cards represented by an array of objects. It provides a menu to perform various actions on the deck of cards like shuffle, draw, compare, etc.

The program uses a vector of Card objects to represent the deck of cards. It has a Card class with suits and ranks as static arrays of strings. The deck is created by populating the vector with 52 Card objects, one for each rank and suit combination.

The menu-driven program provides ten options to perform various operations on the deck of cards. The options are:

Display the deck of cards
Shuffle the deck of cards
Draw a card from the deck
Empty the deck
Print a card from the deck
Compare two cards
Check if two cards are the same
Find a card by rank and suit
Deal a hand of cards
Quit
The program uses a switch statement to handle the user's choice and calls the corresponding method to perform the selected operation.

The program has several methods to handle the various menu options. The displayDeck() method displays the current state of the deck, shuffleDeck() shuffles the deck, drawCard() draws a card from the deck, emptyDeck() empties the deck, printCard() prints a card at a specified position in the deck, compareCard() compares two cards, sameCard() checks if two cards are the same, findCard() finds a card by rank and suit, and dealCard() deals a hand of cards.

Overall, this is a well-designed program that demonstrates the use of a vector of objects to represent a deck of cards and provides a variety of menu-driven operations to manipulate the deck.
