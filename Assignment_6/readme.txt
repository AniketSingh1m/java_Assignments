Assignment 6 - Implementing IntStack and Multiple Inheritance
This project includes two parts:

Implementing an integer stack using fixed storage and growable storage, using an interface defined in a user-defined package called pkg_Stack.
Implementing multiple inheritance in Java.
IntStack Implementation
The Fixed_stk and growable_stk classes implement the Interface_STK interface defined in the pkg_Stack package. Fixed_stk uses a fixed-size array for storage, while growable_stk uses an ArrayList which can grow dynamically.

Multiple Inheritance
The implementation of multiple inheritance is not included in this code file.
